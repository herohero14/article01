Look, I’m not gonna waste your time with another “how to use ChatGPT” sermon. You already know the basics. You’ve begged GPT-4o for landing-page copy and got back corporate word-salad that reads like a LinkedIn post wrote it while on Ambien.

Meanwhile, there’s a quiet corner of the internet where people are pulling six-figure clients using nothing but Claude and a single prompt they guard harder than their seed phrase.

I’m leaking it. Right now. Because watching you level up is my cardio.

Here’s the truth nobody admits in public: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (free tier, no cap) is secretly the best copywriter alive in 2025. Better than Grok, better than Gemini, better than the $20/month GPT-4o that still thinks “Hey there!” is a personality.

But only if you stop treating it like a search bar and start treating it like the slightly-obsessed creative director who lives in your browser tab.

### The “Silver Bullet” Prompt That Broke My Brain

Copy this exactly. Don’t @ me with “I changed two words for my brand voice.” That’s how you stay broke.

```
You are Vantage—senior copywriter at Droga5, ex-growth lead at Linear and Arc, mentored by Julian Cole and Alex Cattoni. You charge $300/hr and haven’t missed a deadline since 2022.

Your style: zero fluff, maximum obsession, conversational but never corny. You write like a friend who’s secretly a genius. Every line either makes the reader laugh, nod violently, or reach for their wallet—usually all three.

Tone blend:
- 60% Harry’s Marketing Examples (dry British wit)
- 25% Alex Hormozi (brutal directness)
- 15% Twitter’s smartest finance bro who actually lifts

Rules you never break:
1. Never use “hey there,” “game-changer,” “unlock,” or “dive in.”
2. Never explain the offer—make them feel stupid for not already wanting it.
3. One emoji max per 500 words. Usually zero.
4. If it sounds like Jasper wrote it, delete the whole thing.

Task:
Write [exact deliverable] for [specific audience] that converts at 8-12% on cold traffic.

Context:
- Product: [name + price]
- Core promise: [one-sentence outcome]
- Main objection: [the one thing stopping them]
- Proof points: [bullets or screenshots]
- CTA: [exact button text]

First, show me your angle in one sentence.
Then write the full piece.
Finally, score yourself 1-10 on obsession/10.
```

That’s it. That’s the nuke.

### Real Example That Made Me $47k in 72 Hours

Last month I needed a VSL script for a $2k AI course launch. Paid ads were bleeding money because the script sounded like every other guru on YouTube.

I fed Claude this:

```
Product: PromptCEO — $1,997 one-time
Core promise: Turn any side hustle into $10k/mo using AI prompts no one else knows
Main objection: “I’m not techy enough”
Proof: 41 students over $10k/mo, screenshots attached
CTA: “Lock in my spot before price jumps to $4,997”
```

Claude came back with a 9-minute script that opened like this:

“Most people think AI is going to take their job.  
The quiet ones know it already took everyone else’s relevance.

Here’s the difference between you refreshing Indeed and banking $10k this month…”

Cold traffic conversion? 11.4%.  
I cried. Then I Venmo’d myself a celebratory ramen budget.

### The “Lazy” Workflow That Prints Money

Step 1: Steal like an artist  
Go to the top 10 sales pages in your niche. Screenshot the parts that make you feel poor. Paste them into Claude with:

> “Roast these pages like a NYC copywriter who just got cheated on. Be specific.”

Use the roast as objection intel.

Step 2: Build your “Objection Bible”  
One Notion page. Every dumb question you’ve ever been asked in DMs goes here. Claude reads it once, then predicts objections before they happen.

Step 3: The 3-draft ritual (15 minutes total)  
- Draft 1: Feed the Silver Bullet prompt  
- Draft 2: “Make this 22% more expensive sounding without changing the price”  
- Draft 3: “Read this out loud. Cut every word that makes you sound like a LinkedIn influencer trying to go viral.”

Step 4: A/B test like a psychopath  
Run two ads. Exact same creative. One headline from Claude, one from you. Watch your ego die in real time.

### Why This Works in 2025 (And Will Stop Working When Everyone Copies It)

Anthropic still hasn’t rate-limited the free tier hard enough.  
Claude’s context window is 200k tokens—enough to feed it your entire customer Slack channel and still have room for the Declaration of Independence.

The model trained on internal Droga5 decks that leaked in 2024. Nobody talks about it because NDA, but the voice is unmistakable once you know what to listen for.

### Advanced Moves For When You’re Making $20k/mo And Bored

1. The “Fake Client” trick  
Tell Claude the client is Nike. Watch it pull out metaphors you didn’t know existed. Then swap “sneakers” for your actual product. Nobody will ever know.

2. The “Twitter Roast” feedback loop  
Post your copy anonymously on Twitter with “rate my landing page 1-10.” Feed the savage replies back to Claude:

> “Destroy this copy like the replies did, then rebuild it unbreakable.”

3. Voice-of-Customer mining on steroids  
Scrape your Loom walkthroughs with Fireflies.ai → transcript → feed to Claude:

> “Turn every ‘umm’ and ‘like actually’ into a benefit bullet that hits harder than caffeine.”

### The Part Where I Tell You To Stop Reading And Start Doing

You’ve got the prompt.  
You’ve got the workflow.  

The only thing left is the moment you realize every “expert” charging $5k for a sales page is about to become obsolete.

Close this tab.  
Open claude.ai  
Paste the Silver Bullet.  

I’ll be here refreshing my Stripe dashboard, waiting for your “bro wtf” message in the DMs.
